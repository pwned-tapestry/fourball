##Git Work Flow##

#To Start Working

1. Fork the https://github.com/pwned-tapestry/thesis repo.

1. Clone to your local machine.

1. Add upstream remote.

  `$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/pwned-tapestry/thesis`

1. Checkout the development branch.

  `git checkout development`

  Note: The first time you do this, you may have to check it out from your fork.
  
  `git checkout -b origin/development`

1. From your local development, checkout a feature_branch to develop on. Name branch after its purpose and add the issue number at the end of its name. Work on that branch.

  For example: 

  `$ git checkout -b feature_api_usernames#11`

  or

  `$ git checkout -b bugfix_panel_swipe#24`

1. Add and commit your code to your feature branch.

  `$git add .`

  `$git commit `

1. When you're ready to make a pull request, you'll need to make sure that your feature branch has all of the commits that have been made to the upstream development branch while you've been developing.

  `$ git pull --rebase upstream development`

  If there are merge conflicts, resolve them by editing the files with conflicts, adding them, and doing a git --rebase continue.

  `$git add `

  `$git --rebase continue`

  If you need a hand with this, ask Nick.

1. After merge conflicts are resolved, push your feature branch to your fork.

  `#from your feature branch`

  `$git push origin feature_api_usernames`

1. Pull request:

  Go to your fork and open a pull request from your feature branch to the project development branch.

  Please reference in the pull request comment the corresponding issue using the [supported keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/).

  For example: 'This closes #27 and closes #5.'

  This will update the waffle.io.

  In the beginning, 2 people from the organization should review feature pull request.

  For documentation, 1 person should review the documentation pull request.

1. After your pull request has been merged, remember to update your local development branch before your cut your next feature branch.

  `$ git checkout development`

  `$ git pull upstream development`

  `$ git checkout -b feature_api_locationData`
