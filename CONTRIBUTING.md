##Git Work Flow##

#To Start Working

1. Fork the https://github.com/pwned-tapestry/fourball repo.

1. Clone to your local machine.

1. Add upstream remote.

  `$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/pwned-tapestry/fourball`

1. Checkout the development branch.

  `git checkout development`

  Note: The first time you do this, you may have to check it out from your fork.

  `git checkout -b origin/development`

1. From your local development, checkout a feature_branch to develop on. Name branch after its purpose and add the issue number at the end of its name. Work on that branch.

  For example:

  `$ git checkout -b feature_api_usernames#11`

  or

  `$ git checkout -b bugfix_panel_swipe#24`

1. Add and commit your code to your feature branch.

  `$git add .`

  `$git commit `

1. When you're ready to make a pull request, you'll need to make sure that your feature branch has all of the commits that have been made to the upstream development branch while you've been developing.

  `$ git pull --rebase upstream development`

  If there are merge conflicts, resolve them by editing the files with conflicts, adding them, and doing a git --rebase continue.

  `$git add `

  `$git --rebase continue`

  If you need a hand with this, ask Nick.

  At this point, your local feature branch should have the entire current upstream project, with your commits played over top of it. This will allow pull requests to be merged automatically.

1. Push your local feature branch to your fork.

  The goal here is to get your local repository to your origin.

  `#from your feature branch`

  `$git push origin feature_api_usernames`

  NOTE: Everyone on our team has had an issue at this stage. It's possible, either through mistakes or confusing instructions, that git will tell you that some refs could not be pushed. And it will give you very vague instructions to 'git pull' from your fork.

  If you've successfully rebased your local repository from the upstream development branch, then your goal is to get your local repo pushed to your fork exactly as you have it on your local feature branch

  In this case you do a:

  `#from your feature branch`

  `git push --force origin feature_api_usernames`

  This will overwrite your origin repo with your local repo.

1. Pull request:

  Go to your fork and open a pull request from your feature branch to the project development branch.

  Please reference in the pull request comment the corresponding issue using the [supported keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/).

  For example: 'This closes #27 and closes #5.'

  This will update the waffle.io.

  In the beginning, 2 people from the organization should review feature pull request.

  For documentation, 1 person should review the documentation pull request.

1. After your pull request has been merged, remember to update your local development branch before you cut your next feature branch.

  `$ git checkout development`

  `$ git pull upstream development`

  `$ git checkout -b feature_api_locationData`
